The tennis courts and climbing walls can be included in that Fitness Center GFA.For the Offices, if they primarily support the fitness center/gym function, they should be included in the same primary Fitness Center GFA. However, if they serve other college departments or functions, you may want to break them out separately as an Office property use. This will affect your whole-building median EUI calculation for comparison, though. I think your benchmarking and tracking plan sounds good as well – while they won’t be able to get a score, comparing themselves against the national median EUI for similar properties can be extremely useful.
