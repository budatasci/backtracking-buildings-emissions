# Backtracking Buildings Emmissions

## Background
According to Boston's Building Emissions Reduction and Disclosure Ordinance (BERDO), organizations with a certain threshold in square footage are required to report the greenhouse gas emissions, energy usage, and energy costs of their buildings. The purpose of BERDO is to make organizations more aware of these factors with the goal of enabling them to reduce all three. For more information on BERDO please refer to their website.

Boston University has decided to report on its entire portfolio of buildings, setting its baseline metrics to 2006. However, since 2006, new buildings have been established on campus, making it impossible to set baseline metrics for them since there is no data dating back to 2006.

## Objective 
Can you estimate the energy use intensity (EUI) of these new buildings if they were to have existed back in 2006 using historical data from research buildings?
